# Written reflection:

## 1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

Once Will and I got got to iteration 3, we read through it all and tried to think up of ways we wanted to break up the work. We decided to build a game class first, and then created our runner once we created enough functionality in the Game class and wanted to see it printed out to the terminal. After that the coding was very dynamic and live. We tried things and discussed things and tried things again. It was more of an intuitive process than planned. We continuously went back and checked over iteration 3 and what we needed to have checked off the list. 

## 2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We would try and fine tune the functionality of the game. And see where there were areas for refactoring. And just overall clean up. 

## 3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

 Will and I live coded together mainly. Someone would be the driver while the other was the navigator and then we would switch. 

## 4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Will and I went back to our DTR and looked over the questions and used it as an opportunity to give each other retrospective feedback. But we both were very good at providing feedback in real time when we were coding together so once we re-visted the DTR there was nothing needed to be communciated.

Our work through the project was more of a process of sharing ideas and pointing out things that we felt our partner may not have noticed in moments. But overall, working together felt very streamlined and easy. It felt collobartive, respcetful, and focused.
